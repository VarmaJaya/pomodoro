Pomodoro Timer Program
This Python project is a Pomodoro Timer built using the Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). The Pomodoro technique is a time management method where work intervals are broken up by short breaks, and every four work intervals are followed by a longer break. The timer visually displays the countdown and tracks work sessions, providing a simple yet effective tool for focused productivity.

Features:
Work and Break Intervals: The timer alternates between a 25-minute work session, a 5-minute short break, and a 20-minute long break after every four work sessions.
Start and Reset: Users can start the timer with a "Start" button and reset it using the "Reset" button.
Visual Countdown: The countdown timer is displayed in the center of a tomato image to represent the Pomodoro technique.
Checkmarks for Progress: After each completed work session, a checkmark (âœ”) is displayed, allowing users to visually track their progress.
Responsive UI: The UI is responsive, designed with clear buttons and labels, and uses color-coding for work (green) and break (red or pink) intervals.
How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Ensure the tomato.png image is in the same directory as the script, as it is used in the UI.
Run the Python script to launch the timer.
Pomodoro Workflow:
Start a 25-minute work session.
Take a 5-minute break after each session.
After four sessions, take a 20-minute long break.
Checkmarks will appear after each work session to track your progress.
